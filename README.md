# HBR Spring Savings Event 2016 - Responsive Email

Released: Original and follow-up emails sent in April 2016

Harvard Business Review (HBR) sent an email marketing promotion in April 2016 sharing a 20% off $50 or more or $10 off $50 or more discount for the HBR Store. This is the 20% off $50 or more version of the email with a few improvements. 

The template is a responsive email developed with [Foundation for Emails 2 by Zurb] (http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html). I built the email using the CSS version of the framework.
